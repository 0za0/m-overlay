### Usage

This program hooks into Dolphin and reads from memory to show a players inputs. This could be an alternative to Nintendo-Spy for those who don't have the technical prowess of setting up an Arduino.

Currently this program will only work on Melee v1.02 (NTSC), but should work on any ANY version of dolphin.

To use with OBS, add a "Game Capture" source and use "capture specific window" "[M'Overlay.exe]"
and be sure to check "Allow Transparency"

### Why?

This is the start of a bigger project to make a fully customizable stream overlay. I plan on making a fully customizable overlay system to show different elements of the game, like percents, stocks, game time, an off camera minimap (like Smash Ultimate), APM meters, controller inputs, and much more. The plan is to have a plugin system for people to script their own overlay elements.
